If I solve the problem then it's here, I'm starting from the easiest questions focusing on alternatives solutions and dividing them in topics like string, math, arrays and integer solving each topic in batch at a time. 

I've learnt different things on my journey 

HashTables
Brute force then one liner(lmao)
linked Lists
